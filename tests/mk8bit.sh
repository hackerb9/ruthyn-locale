# Print a quick table of so called "high ASCII" characters, that is,
# all bytes from 0x80 to 0xFF. This is useful for testing locales such
# as Latin-1 which use a single 8-bit byte instead of Unicode.

# Output is sized to fit on a 40x16 terminal (for Tandy-200).

# On a terminal with an 8-bit locale, such as a VT-340 set to Latin-1:
#	mk8bit.sh	# Show 0x80 to 0xFF 
#	mk8bit.sh -a	# Show 0x20 to 0xFF (adds 7-bit ASCII).
#	mk8bit.sh -A	# Show 0x00 to 0xFF (also sends control characters).

# On a UTF-8 capable terminal:
# 	mk8bit.sh -f l1		# Convert from Latin-1 characterset to UTF-8
# 	mk8bit.sh -a -f t200	# Convert from Tandy-200 characterset
